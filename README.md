# Four Flags RPG

Four Flags - practical project of the course which I have made by collaborating with three other colleagues from the academy. It represents a C# text console game. In the game you have to choose a race for your hero where each race can provide you a different set of stats. The game offers you several quests where you encounter on your path different enemies. In each battle you have the options to attack your enemy, to heal yourself or to run away from the battle. If you win the battle you obtain certain weapon and healing items which you can save in your backpack. During the game you are able to open your inventory and equip yourself with the best items you have.
